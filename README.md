SURGE LINK: http://quiz-app-pwa-by-saad.surge.sh/

    Surge link will not work as The FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) SDK is supported only in pages served over HTTPS. This is due to its use of service workers, which are available only on HTTPS sites.

    This is the reason I am using netlify and firebase hosting. you can use one of them.
